This is an automated test suite for APM
Make sure py files are executable along with sh and pyc
Also change the permissions in the pysim directory
We seem to be using just this command

./autotest.py build.ArduCopter fly.ArduCopter --map

Sometimes we use a --viewerip=x.x.x.x flag but I think
that requires mission planner or APM running somewhere else
